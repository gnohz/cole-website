Let's talk about food.

There is so much food to eat, but basically they can all by quantified on the following dimensions:

-   taste
-   nutrition / volume
-   time
-   cost

When choosing what to eat I try to optimize for:

-   (nutrition) / (dollar + time)

Interestingly enough this started when I was quite young. Sometimes when my family would stop in gas stations this kids would each get to pick a candy bar. My approach was to go for whichever candy bar had the most calories and weight per dollar.

This is why I recently starting having soylent for lunch. So far i'm having a great time. We will see how long it lasts.

Depends on your tolerance for work. Sometimes you need a break, and cooking can be a good way to spend that break.

What are the components of eating? I argue that eating brings the following pros and cons.

Picking what to eat.

There are typically two steps associated with eating food:

-   obtaining/preparing/cleaning the food
-   consuming the food


# Pros: {#pros}

-   Alleviate hunger
-


# Cons: {#cons}

if i didn't feel hungry, I wouldn't eat as often

I'd rather not eat and do the socializing.

People have different weights. For me it is very much balanced towards:

-   nutrition / dollar

nutrition includes calories.

Taste has relatively little influence (there is some obviously).
